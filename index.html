    <h1>Favourite place is Ooty</h1>
    <p>Summer Vacation is the time for fun and enjoyment. We plan trips during summer vacation every year. We stay in Madurai and our place was very hot this Summer. We planned to visit a good hill station and spend time with our family. We went in a van with all our cousins’ family. It was great entertainment touring and staying with everyone. We stayed in a resort for 3 days. We visited all famous destinations in Ooty. The best experience was the flower show. It was overwhelming to see so many colorful all at a time in one single place</p>
